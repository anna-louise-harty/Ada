1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?  

 I enjoy rock climbing, although it has often been said about climbing that when you arrive at the top of a route, as great as the view may be, the only thing you’ve really obtained is the experiences that got you to that point.  What I love about programming is that you get to record and learn from new experiences while also being able to share a potentially groundbreaking final product.  Currently, I’ve been solving the Jumpstart problems and some easy puzzles such as FizzBuzz.  Some of the Jumpstart problems have been relatively simple to solve, others such as the Accounts Generator took me over a day of thinking and trying out different solutions.  I find it very satisfying that I can walk away from a problem, eat some lunch, and come back with three new ways to potentially solve that section of code.  I am also excited by the idea of continuous improvement; I have talked to coders about how they go back and refactor their old codes to be more succinct and readable. Finally, I am a lifelong language learner, which is why I spent a year in Chile learning Spanish in context.  I love learning new ways of communicating and their associated thought patterns.  This is why I have also been exposing myself to coding through Codecademy lessons on different languages, and I am enthusiastic about all of the programing languages that are out there to be learned.  I would love to use Ada to build a strong base in the theory behind coding as well as to solidify the thought patterns associated with programing and then expand my knowledge to include other languages.  I have heard from a few friends that Python is the most logically beautiful of the languages, and I will be studying it next after I finish learning how to upload this document onto Github.  

2. If you are accepted into our program, where do you see your career in 5 years?  

 In five years I see myself empowering young people through workshops on coding.  I deeply align with Ada’s mission to diversifying the technology sector.  I believe that the younger you can start this exposure, the more one foundational experience can demystify the STEM world and empower students to feel they can be successful regardless of how many reflections of themselves they see in that field.  It is for these reasons that I would like to take the skills I learn at Ada, and the experiences I gain working to design education apps, and use them to create workshops for schools in underserved and under resourced communities.  I would prefer to do this as volunteer work while continuing pushing my thinking and improve my silks by developing education apps, such as one for my friend’s company Language Lifestyles, or projects that combine aspects of NewsELA and Duolingo along with avatars and games to give struggling readers support with understanding independent readings.  I believe that through engaging apps that provide reading supports we could see a change in the national number of students reading below grade level.  

3. After reading Ada's Vision, Mission and Inclusivity Statement, how will you contribute to Ada's vision for an inclusive and diverse community? http://adadevelopersacademy.org/program  

 First and foremost I would bring the mindset of ‘suspending judgements’ to the Ada community.  I encountered and practiced this theory while a Corps Member for Teach for America but I have applied it widely since then.  With this mindset, rather than making assumptions about someone based on something they have done or said, you ask questions and attempt to understand where they are coming from.  I have found that this is a great way of overcoming differences and, if everyone is using it, of fostering a trusting and inclusive community.  Secondly, I would bring my own intersecting identities including being a queer female, along with an awareness of my privileged identity markers (these include but are not limited to being white, being young, being able bodied, being cisgendered), to the software development world, thereby contributing my schema to a field dominated by the male perspective.  Finally, I would like to become an ally to Ada’s mission by providing experiential lessons on coding, leadership and inclusivity to young learners.  

4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

 My first year of teaching was a series of small wins with individual students relentlessly flanked by big mistake after big mistake, mistakes which of course my middle school students ensured I would never forget.  I once stay up all night completing writing packets based on our reading of the book “Monster” by Walter Dean Myers only to forget to save the final draft and print 80 copies of the wrong 25 page packet.  Among the changes I had made was modifying a section where I asked the students to look at some graphs and statistics from studies on the US justice system.  In an effort to save paper, as we had to pay for our own, I retained as many pages of the packet as I could, and reprinted only the most necessary.  The day we got to the statistics, I learned something monumental, how to ask for help.  I called my assistant principal in halfway through the lesson, which was going up in flames before my very eyes, and asked her to help.  To help explain that these numbers came from independent studies and were not my personal beliefs, to refocus the class on our intended daily outcome which was to analyze prejudice in the justice system in preparation for proposing how the system could be improved upon, to help re-staple the packets which had been ripped up in protest.  And afterward to ask her how I might repair the fragile trusts I had damaged that day.  If I could redo this, I would reprint the page with the most loaded statistic at the end instead of the beginning and remove it from the packet.  I would spend one day having my students ask questions and make assumptions about how the justice system might profile different groups of people. I would do a whole class analysis of a light hearted statistic and have them explain the difference between an assumption, an opinion and a statistic.  I would connect the statistic to feelings, and would go back to the questions they had formed about profiling in the justice system and ask them to think of how people in these groups might feel about the justice system.  I think this was a crucial step that was missing, in order to make a difficult topic easier I had tried to focus on ‘just the facts’ but I did not provide a space for the very personal feelings that tied my students to these statistics.  The next day, before bringing up the statistics, I would have explained why I was personally invested in this assignment and why I had chosen a difficult topic and how I felt knowing that two of the students who used to be sitting in front of me were behind bars.  I would have also asked them to take notes in the margins of two things: how this makes me feel and what would I change.  I can’t undo the lesson, all I can do is learn: to listen to and validate the feeling and the realities of others, to take these feelings into consideration before acting, to ask more questions than I answer, that there is no shame in asking for help when you need it, and also, that it’s important to always save twice before quitting and review before printing.
