# Ada
Information for Ada application including resume and essay questions.

Information prepared by Anna Harty, age 26 currently living in Iowa City, IA but excited to relocate.  After teaching for the last three years, I have decided I would like to modify my direction and learning to program is the next big step in my journey.  I am excited for the opportunity to apply to Ada and I am hopeful for the chance to become a part of of a team of motivated women!
