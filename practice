I am a lifelong language learner who loves learning new ways of communicating and their associated thought patterns.  
 This is why I spent a year in Chile learning Spanish in context and it is why I would like to expand my knowedgle and unlock new ways of problem solving by learning to program.  
 I've been using Coursera and Codecademy to learn the basics of programming, but just like using Duolingo and Mangoconnect was not suffiecent to become fluent in Spanish, taking a few online courses is not enough to become a competent programmer. 
 I believe that you must fully immerse yourself into a new language if you want to achieve fluency and profiency, and I am positive the Ada program would provide that atmosphere.  
 I am also passionate about programming because I enjoy the challenge of finding out new ways to solve problems.  
 I worked through the Jumpstart problems and have been exposing myself to other problems through the sub reddits [r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming) and [r/programmingprompts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingPrompts/).  
 Some of the problems have been relatively simple to solve, others such as the Accounts Generator took me over a day of thinking and trying out different solutions.  
 However, I find it very satisfying that with a determination, I can come back to a problem with three new potential solutions.  
 Which is great because I am also excited by the idea of continuous improvement and the ability to refactor code and find more succint ways to write something is exciting to me.
